## Known Issues

1. [Remove FQDN suffix dependency in the name when configuring an NSX-T cloud account in vRealize Operations](https://github.com/vmware-samples/validated-solutions-for-cloud-foundation/issues/35)

    Please make sure that your NSX-T account name is configured as mentioned in this issue.

2. The vCenter Server name needs to be updated in VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.x. The filters on the vRealize Operations dashboards depend on the name.

    To set the Product Name for the vCenter Server, follow the below steps:

    1. Log in to the management domain vCenter Server at `https://<management_vcenter_server_fqdn>/ui` as `administrator@vsphere.local`.
    2. In the `VMs and templates` inventory, expand the `management domain vCenter Server` tree and expand the management domain data center.
    3. Select the first `management domain vCenter Server virtual machine` and select `Configure` tab.
    4. In the `Settings` pane select `vApp Options`.
    5. Click the `Edit` button. The `Edit vApp Options` dialog box opens.
    6. If vApp options are disabled, select the `Enable vApp options` check box and click `OK`.
    7. Click the `Details` tab and enter `VMware vCenter Server Appliance` as product name in the `Name` field.

3. Shades of red, green, and yellow may vary on vRealize Operations widgets

    Shades of red, green, and yellow may be different in different widgets but they represent the same thing. Ignore the shades as this is a vRealize Operations product limitation.
