## Install the Python Module in a Disconnected Environment
For environments disconnected from the Internet (e.g., dark-site, air-gapped), you can save the Health Reporting and Monitoring Python module and its dependencies from the PyPI using the below instructions. 

### For Photon OS - 

- On the target system, create a directory to save the Python modules
```
  mkdir -p /opt/vmware/hrm-modules
```

- From a system with an Internet connection, make a modules directory and create a new file `requirements.txt` inside it. 
```
  mkdir -p /home/hrm-modules/
  cd /home/hrm-modules/
  vi requirements.txt
```
- Add below content to the `requirements.txt` file and save it. 
```
requests
setuptools
paramiko
maskpass==0.3.1
```

- Create another file `module.txt` in the same location.
```
  vi module.txt
```
  
- Add below content to the `module.txt` file and save it. 
```
vmware-cloud-foundation-health-monitoring
```
  
- From a system with an Internet connection, save the module and its dependencies from PyPI by running the following commands in the terminal:

```
  pip download -r module.txt
  pip download -r requirements.txt
```

- From the system with an Internet connection, copy the module and its dependencies to a target system by running the following commands in the terminal:
```
  scp -r /home/vcf/hrm-modules/* username@remote_host:/opt/vmware/hrm-modules/
```
  
- On the target system, install the module and its dependencies by running the following commands in the terminal:
```
  cd /opt/vmware/hrm-modules
  pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index --find-links .
  pip install -r module.txt --no-index --find-links . -t /opt/vmware/hrm-<sddc_manager_vm_name>
```

### For Windows Server -

- From a system with an Internet connection, make a modules folder `F:\hrm-modules`.

- Create a new file `requirements.txt` inside the modules folder. 

- Add the below content to the `requirements.txt` file and save it. 
```
requests
setuptools
paramiko
maskpass==0.3.1
```
- In the modules folder `f:\hrm-modules`, create a new file `module.txt` 
  
- Add below content to `module.txt` file and save it. 
```
vmware-cloud-foundation-health-monitoring
```

- From a system with an Internet connection, save the module and its dependencies from PyPI by running the following commands from cmdline:

```
  cd f:\hrm-modules
  pip download -r module.txt 
  pip download -r requirements.txt
```

- From the system with the Internet connection, copy the module and its dependencies to a target system by running the following commands in the PowerShell console:

```
  Copy-Item -Path F:\hrm-modules\* -Destination '\\<destination_host>\C$\vmware\hrm-modules
```

- On the target system, install the module and its dependencies by running the following commands in the terminal:
```
  cd c:\vmware\hrm-modules
  pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index --find-links .
  pip install -r module.txt --no-index --find-links . -t c:\vmware\hrm-<sddc_manager_vm_name>
```


**Once the Python modules are installed, continue to follow the [Implementation of Health Reporting and Monitoring for VMware Cloud Foundation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/vcf-health-reporting-and-monitoring-v1/GUID-AD58BAF1-7DC9-4514-90B7-7E9FA2E9E5FA.html) from [Health Reporting and Monitoring for VMware Cloud Foundation](https://core.vmware.com/health-reporting-and-monitoring-vmware-cloud-foundation)**

## Updating the Python Module to the Latest Version

### For Photon OS -

## Known Issues

1. [Remove FQDN suffix dependency in the name when configuring an NSX-T cloud account in VMware Aria Operations](https://github.com/vmware-samples/validated-solutions-for-cloud-foundation/issues/35)

    Please make sure that your NSX-T account name is configured as mentioned in this issue.

2. The vCenter Server name needs to be updated in VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.x. The filters on the VMware Aria Operations dashboards depend on the name.

    To set the Product Name for the vCenter Server, follow the below steps:

    1. Log in to the management domain vCenter Server at `https://<management_vcenter_server_fqdn>/ui` as `administrator@vsphere.local`.
    2. In the `VMs and templates` inventory, expand the `management domain vCenter Server` tree and expand the management domain data center.
    3. Select the first `management domain vCenter Server virtual machine` and select `Configure` tab.
    4. In the `Settings` pane select `vApp Options`.
    5. Click the `Edit` button. The `Edit vApp Options` dialog box opens.
    6. If vApp options are disabled, select the `Enable vApp options` check box and click `OK`.
    7. Click the `Details` tab and enter `VMware vCenter Server Appliance` as product name in the `Name` field.

3. Shades of red, green, and yellow may vary on VMware Aria Operations widgets

    Shades of red, green, and yellow may be different in different widgets but they represent the same thing. Ignore the shades as this is a VMware Aria Operations product limitation.
