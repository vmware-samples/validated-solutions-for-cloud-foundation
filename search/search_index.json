It will be phased out in a future release of vSphere. See the vSphere 7.0 Release Notes and KB 78506.</p> Why is use of an external identity provider not used in the solution? <p>The use of an external identity provider is not included. However, the use is supported with the vSphere version used in this validated solution, but may introduce issues for other integrated solutions.</p> Is LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) required by the solution? <p>No. This validated solution is based on the use of LDAPS for the connections between vCenter Server to Microsoft Active Directory. LDAP can be used during the configuration if required; however, Microsoft recommends a hardened configuration for LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing on Active Directory domain controllers. For more information, see Microsoft Security Advisory ADV190023.</p> Does the solution provide any automation of initial deployment or on-going tasks? <p>Yes. This validated solution includes the optional use of Microsoft PowerShell cmdlets to perform many of the deployment and configuration procedures. You must first install the required PowerShell modules. The subsequent procedure options will set the minimally required variables and automate the procedure.</p> Do I need to join ESXi hosts to the Active Directory domain? <p>No. It's not required or recommended to join ESXi hosts in a VMware Cloud Foundation system to Active Directory. SDDC Manager manages the commissioning, configuration, and lifecycle of the ESXi hosts. In the event that direct access to a ESXi host is required, the Cloud Administrator can obtain the root or SERVICE account credentials to troubleshoot any issues with the ESXi host. However, there are circumstances when you must enable Active Directory as the authentication system by joining each ESXi host to an Active Directory domain. VMware Cloud Foundation supports the use of NFS version 4.1 (and version 3) as supplemental storage. With NFS version 4.1, ESXi supports the RPCSEC_GSS Kerberos mechanism authentication service. It allows the built-in NFS 4.1 client for ESXi to prove its identity to an NFS server before mounting an NFS share. The Kerberos security uses cryptography to work across an insecure network connection. To use Kerberos authentication, each ESXi host that mounts that mounts an NFS 4.1 datastore must be joined to the required Active Directory domain and the NFS Kerberos credentials must be set on each host.</p> Can I deploy this solution on Dell VxRail? <p>Yes.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#developer-ready-infrastructure","title":"Developer Ready Infrastructure","text":"Which architecture model for VMware Cloud Foundation is used in the solution? <p>The solution is optimized for the standard architecture model with VMware Cloud Foundation instances consisting of a management domain and one or more workload domains.</p> <p>There are no known technical blockers to using this solution in the consolidated architecture, however you should consider the following:</p> <p>This combination is not explicitly tested by the VMware Validated Solution team.</p> <p>While the Planning &amp; Preparation workbook will display the management domain values instead of the workload domain values, but there may be nuances where the process slightly differs in the management domain vs the workload domain.</p> <p>You should ensure Management Domain performance is not effected by leveraging resource pools and by regular monitoring of resource consumption.</p> Must I follow the naming and IP addressing format mentioned within the solution? <p>No. Customers should utilize the VMware Cloud Foundation Planning and Preparation Workbook to capture their own naming and IP addressing requirements and then use the workbook when following the implementation procedures.</p> Can I build on top of this with Tanzu Standard/Advanced/Enterprise? <p>This solution is loosely coupled with Tanzu Basic, but you may build on top of it using any of the tooling included with other Tanzu license bundles.</p> Must I use Microsoft Active Directory users and groups for Role Based Access Control? Can I just use vsphere.local users in vCenter Single Sign-On? <p>To deploy a compliant solution, you must use Active Directory users/groups for Role Based Access Control (RBAC). That said, vCenter SSO users will work fine. You should use an enterprise solution for access control to ensure auditability of logins and actions performed.</p> Does the solution provide any automation of initial deployment or on-going tasks? <p>Yes.
